Tales of the Lesser known Reindeer.

Recent discussion with my 5 year old has sparked interest in which
reindeer is the favorite. She says Rudolph, but I scoff. Rudolf is all hype, 
he got a good PR agent, and now he's famous! But that doesnt mean he is the best.
Hes good for Fog, sure, but in the North Pole, its very cold, and fog isnt all 
that common.
Personaly, I enjoy the lightning fast delivery that Blitzen offers, and the 
casual entertianment Dancer, and Vixen provide. But let us now look at other options
for choosing the best reindeer!

Do you know the most famous Reindeer of all?
Of course you do!

But this isnt a story about the famous reindeer,
this is a story about the Lesser known reindeer.

Reindeer such as Big Horn.
Big Horn has large ... Antlers.
He likes to sing, and has plenty of Christmass Cheer, 
but his huge antlers poke the other reindeer, and make it hard for them to see. 
For this reason he was dejected from Santa's team of Reindeer, and never became
famed. 
Big horn now resides in the Ancient Crystal Tundras of the Artic.
Elven lore describes his large white antlers as camofluage, looking like the many snow crystal covered 
shrubberies indiginous to that area. He likes to sneak up on other creatures that wander by, and shout 
ABHUBHUHEWABUAHEWHEW!


SnowBall: The albino reindeer. 
Back when Rudolf wasnt so popular, Snowball and rudolf used to hang out. 
Snow ball is nearly invisible in the Arctic, in, or out of a snowstorm. the only hint you might see 
is snowball's hoof prints in the snow. Since reindeer can fly, and hover, if Snowball wants to be completely
invisible, he can.
